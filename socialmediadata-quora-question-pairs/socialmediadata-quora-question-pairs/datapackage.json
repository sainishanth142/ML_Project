{"name":"socialmediadata_quora-question-pairs","title":"Quora Question Pairs","description":"First Quora Dataset Release: Question Pairs\n\nFirst [Quora](http://www.quora.com) \nDataset Release: Question Pairs\n\n\nThe dataset that was released [January 24] will give anyone the opportunity to train and test models of semantic equivalence, based on actual Quora data. We are eager to see how diverse approaches fare on this problem.\n \nOur dataset consists of over 400,000 lines of potential question duplicate pairs. Each line contains IDs for each question in the pair, the full text for each question, and a binary value that indicates whether the line truly contains a duplicate pair. Here are a few sample lines of the dataset:\n\n\nHere are a few important things to keep in mind about this dataset:\n\nOur original sampling method returned an imbalanced dataset with many more true examples of duplicate pairs than non-duplicates. Therefore, we supplemented the dataset with negative examples. One source of negative examples were pairs of “related questions” which, although pertaining to similar topics, are not truly semantically equivalent.\nThe distribution of questions in the dataset should not be taken to be representative of the distribution of questions asked on Quora. This is, in part, because of the combination of sampling procedures and also due to some sanitization measures that have been applied to the final dataset (e.g., removal of questions with extremely long question details).\nThe ground-truth labels contain some amount of noise: they are not guaranteed to be perfect.\n\nShared by: [KORNÉL CSERNAI](https://www.quora.com/profile/Korn%C3%A9l-Csernai)\nAuthors: [Shankar Iyer](https://data.world/shankariyer), Nikhil Dandekar, and Kornél Csernai   \n  \n\n[**Terms of Services**](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)\n**Source**: [data.quora.com](https://data.quora.com/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs)","homepage":"https://data.world/socialmediadata/quora-question-pairs","license":"Other","resources":[{"name":"quora_duplicate_questions","schema":{"fields":[{"name":"id","title":"id","type":"integer","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer","dwSourceId":"id"},{"name":"qid1","title":"qid1","type":"integer","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer","dwSourceId":"qid1"},{"name":"qid2","title":"qid2","type":"integer","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer","dwSourceId":"qid2"},{"name":"question1","title":"question1","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"question1"},{"name":"question2","title":"question2","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"question2"},{"name":"is_duplicate","title":"is_duplicate","type":"boolean","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#boolean","dwSourceId":"is_duplicate"}]},"path":"data/quora_duplicate_questions.csv","format":"csv"},{"name":"original/quora_duplicate_questions.tsv","path":"original/quora_duplicate_questions.tsv","format":"tsv","mediatype":"text/tab-separated-values","bytes":58354113}],"keywords":["quora","questions","trivia","information","faq","nlp","machine learning"]}
